# Adding new provider

Template of project files structure:

On client:
```text
ansible_plugins/
|-- plugins
|   |-- module_utils
|   |   |-- cloud_infra_by_tosca.py
```

In provider tool:
```text
provider_tool/
|-- providers
|   |-- <provider>
|   |   |-- provider.cfg
|   |   |-- tosca_elements_map_to_provider.json
|   |   |-- TOSCA_<provider>_definition_1_0.yaml
```

The `<provider>` means the provider's unique nic. Adding new provider
includes several steps.

## Prestep: considering main components of cloud

There is set of common parameters to launch virtual machine. This
parameters are manages in different ways by different providers and a
unified by TOSCA.

* *private address* - the primary private IP address assigned by the cloud provider that applications may use to access the Compute node.
* *public address* - he primary public IP address assigned by the cloud provider that applications may use to access the Compute node.
* *networks/ports*: network names or ids or port names or ids or addresses
* *host*: number of CPUs, disk size, RAM size or CPU frequency
* *endpoint* - network access endpoint capability
    * *protocol* - http, https, ftp, tcp, udp, etc
    * *port* of endpoint
    * *url path* of endpoint's address if applicable for the protocol
    * *port name* which endpoint should be bound to
    * *network name* which endpoint should be bound to
    * *initiator* - one of: source, target, peer
    * *IP address* as propagated up by the associated nodeâ€™s host (Compute)
      container
    * if *secured* connection
* *os* - operating system parameters:
    * *architecture* - x86_32, x86_64, etc.
    * *type* - linux, aix, mac, windows, etc.
    * *distribution* -  debian, fedora, rhel and ubuntu
    * *version*
* *scalable*: min, default, max of instances to launch
* *volumes*: local storages

## Step 1: Defining main components of cloud provider

Prestep results in set of virtual cloud resources containing required
parameters (instances, images, security groups, etc.)

Define main components definitions in language specified by TOSCA.

The template of definition file must be:

```yaml
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_0
capability_types:
    <provider>.capabilities.Root:
        derived_from: tosca.capabilities.Root
    <...>
node_types:
    <provider>.nodes.Root:
        derived_from: tosca.nodes.Root
        capabilities:
            feature:
                type: <provider>.capabilities.Node
                occurrences: [ 1, 1 ]
        requirements:
            - dependency:
                capability: <provider>.capabilities.Node
                node: <provider>.nodes.Root
                relationship: <provider>.relationships.DependsOn
                occurrences: [ 0, UNBOUNDED ]
    <...>
relationship_types:
    <provider>.relationships.DependsOn:
        description: This type results in ordering of initializing objects.
        derived_from: tosca.relationships.DependsOn
        valid_target_types: [ <provider>.capabilities.Node ]
    <...>
```

Examples can be found in `toscatranslator/providers/<provider>`
directories.

## Step 2: Defining mapping between tosca.nodes.Compute and main components of cloud provider

This step is the declarative defining of mapping considered in Prestep
using definitions from Step 1.

This mapping represents in either JSON or YAML format. Further the rules
to describe the mapping are provided.

The parameters of TOSCA normative node type are determined as keys, and
the parameters of the provider node types are determined as values. All
parameters name must include the node type and the parameter section and
name, which called *extended parameter name*. For example,
`tosca.nodes.Compute.attributes.private_address`.

The values are represented in format, called *value format*. The value
format can be of type list, map and string. If the value is of type map,
then it's one of the following cases:

* keys are `parameter`, `value`, `keyname`: `parameter` contains the name
  of the specialized type parameter, the `value` contains the value of
  this parameter, `keyname` specialises the name of the node topology in
  which to add this parameter, `keyname` can be used to create several
  nodes of the same type. Be attentive and sure you don't set existing names.
  Example:

~~~yaml
tosca.nodes.Compute.capabilities.host.properties.num_cpus:
  parameter: openstack.nodes.Server.requirements
             .flavor.node_filter.properties.vcpus
  value: {self[value]}
~~~
* keys are `error`, `reason`: used if the parameter cannot be specified
  in TOSCA template for a certain reason.

* keys are `source`, `parameters`, `extra`, `value`, `executor`: used to
  add operation implementation and hence create a relationship, `source`
  represents the name of ansible module or any other command or source
  of a specific executor or the file name to execute,
  `parameters` are the arguments of the source,
  `extra` is the extra info, if Ansible is used `parameters` are the
  arguments of module and `extra` are the extra parameters of the task,
  `value` represents variable name passing after script execution,
  it can be unnecessary but must be defined any way,
  `executor` represents the configuration tool or some
  another supported executor (ex. ansible, python). Example:

~~~yaml
- source: set_fact
  executor: ansible
  parameters:
    new_var: 1
  value: tmp_value
# example with python script
- source: transform_units
  parameters:
    source_value: "{self[value]}"
    is_without_b: True
  executor: python
  value: default
~~~

* keys are `value`, `condition`, `facts`, `arguments`, `executor`: used if the value must
  be first chosen from existing cloud resources, `facts` represents the source which is use to get list
  of cloud resources paramters, facts need to be filtered for some value satisfying some `condition` and its
  `arguments`. Three conditions are supported: `equals`, `contains`, `ip_contains`. Example:

~~~yaml
tosca.nodes.Compute.attributes.networks.*
                .addresses:
parameter: openstack.nodes.Server.requirements
                .nics.node_filter.properties.id
value:
  - value: network_id
  condition: ip_contains
  facts: os_subnets_facts.ansible_facts.openstack_subnets
  executor: ansible
  arguments:
  - allocation_pool_start
  - allocation_pool_end
  - "{self[value]}"
~~~

**ATTENTION**. Please don't use reserved keys in you mapping values,
ex. replace 'parameter' key by 'input_parameter'.

The interpreter also defines a variable `self` that can be used to store
and read some values in a key-value format. For example:

~~~yaml
tosca.nodes.Compute.endpoint.attributes.ip_address:
  parameter: {self[buffer][security_group_rule][cidr_ip]}
  value: {self[value]}
tosca.nodes.Compute.endpoint.properties.initiator.target:
  parameter: amazon.nodes.SecurityGroup.properties.rules
  value:
    - {self[buffer][security_group_rule]}
~~~

There are also predefined values:
* `parameter` contains the extended name of TOSCA normative type parameter
* `value` contains the value defined by the key `parameter` in TOSCA
  template
* `name` contains the current node name

As a result, any updates of cloud API or new versions of TOSCA standard
causes only minor changes in the interpreter cloud definitions, which
simplifies the process of adding a new cloud provider support.

**ATTENTION** You shouldn't use multiple type deriviation from each other
except default deriviation from Root. As it's unknown actions to resolve
dependencies from parents.


## Step 3: Provider configuration file

Every provider is configured with configuration file which can be one
the following (sorted by priority):
1. `<provider>.cfg` in the working directory where user executes Clouni
1. `toscatranslator/providers/<provider>/provider.cfg` in `$TOSCA_HOME`
1. `toscatranslator/providers/<provider>/<provider>.cfg` in `$TOSCA_HOME`

`<provider>` means provider's nic in Clouni

It has required settings for Clouni execution:

~~~ini
[main]
tosca_elements_definition_file = TOSCA_openstack_definition_1_0.yaml
tosca_elements_map_file = tosca_elements_map_to_openstack.yaml
~~~

* `tosca_elements_definition_file` points to the name of the file created in Step 1
* `tosca_elements_map_file` points to the name of the file created in Step 2

Paths to the specified files must be absolute or from the directory where
provider configuration file is located.

Configuration tools are configured for every provider in provider configuration file.
Settings must be in section names with the configuration tool. For example:

~~~ini
[ansible]
module_prefix = os_
module_description = Create OpenStack component
~~~

* `module_prefix` is added to the name of provider component type, for example if openstack.nodes.Server is created
  then `os_server` Ansible module will be used
* `module_description` is added as a description to the Ansible module

Every configuration tool can have it's own setting parameters

If the mapping from Step 2 uses TOSCA `node_filter`
([example](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0-os.html#_Toc471725299)),
then the following section must be specified for every supported configuration tool:

~~~ini
[ansible.node_filter]
node_filter_source_prefix = os_
node_filter_source_postfix = _facts
node_filter_exceptions =
    subnet = os_subnets_facts
node_filter_inner_variable =
    image = ansible_facts,openstack_image
    flavor = ansible_facts,openstack_flavors
~~~

* `node_filter_source_prefix`, `node_filter_source_postfix` is added to the name of provider component type,
  for example if openstack.nodes.Server is need to be filtered
  then `os_server_facts` Ansible module will be used
* `node_filter_exceptions` is of key = value format and is used if prefix and postfix is not enough,
  for example openstack.nodes.Subnet would be filtered by `os_subnets_facts` not `os_subnet_facts`
* `node_filter_inner_variable` is used to specify JSON keys if facts were received not as list,
  for example facts for openstack.nodes.Image would be received by module `os_image_facts` and the return value
  would be `image_facts = output_os_image_facts["ansible_facts"]["openstack_image"]`
